At its core, AI is the science of developing algorithms, models, and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks encompass a wide range of activities, from problem-solving and decision-making to understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and learning from data.\n","\n","One of the foundational principles of AI is the concept of machine learning, wherein AI systems can improve their performance on a specific task through exposure to data and experience, rather than relying solely on explicit programming. Machine learning algorithms enable AI systems to identify patterns, make predictions, and adapt to changing conditions, making them incredibly versatile and applicable across various domains.\n","\n","AI can be categorized into two broad types:\n","\n","Narrow or Weak AI: This type of AI is designed to excel at specific tasks or domains. Examples include voice assistants like Siri or recommendation systems on streaming platforms. While they may seem intelligent within their specialized scope, they lack general intelligence and self-awareness.\n","\n","General or Strong AI: This represents the aspiration of creating AI systems with human-level intelligence and cognitive abilities. General AI would possess the capacity to understand, learn, and adapt across a wide range of tasks and contexts, similar to human intelligence. Achieving true general AI remains a long-term goal and a subject of ongoing research.\n","\n","AI technologies encompass a diverse set of techniques and approaches, including neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning, among others. These tools find applications across numerous sectors, such as healthcare (diagnosis and treatment optimization), finance (algorithmic trading and fraud detection), transportation (autonomous vehicles), and entertainment (video game AI and content recommendation).\n","\n","While AI holds immense promise, it also raises ethical and societal questions related to privacy, bias, transparency, and the potential impact on the workforce. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial to ensure responsible development and deployment, guided by ethical principles and a commitment to harnessing its potential for the betterment of society. In essence, AI represents a powerful and transformative force in the modern world, with the potential to reshape industries, improve efficiency, and enhance our understanding of intelligence and cognition.\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3P0YAtqXU5nD"},"source":["### Created a parser for the model as its need data to be sentence form"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1693648560103,"user":{"displayName":"shubham mandowara","userId":"01086830669491528691"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"oF358uWBUMgt"},"outputs":[],"source":["text = text.lower() #
